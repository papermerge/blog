# Release 3.4 and What's Next


## Release 3.4

Release [3.4](https://github.com/papermerge/papermerge-core/releases/tag/3.4) is out ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰!


## What's Next?

Here is rough plan of what is going to happen next.
First of all, we will update documentation and publish couple of videos with new features.

There are people using 2.0 and 2.1 versions.
We will provide scripts and support for migrating away from these versions to
the newest one. Once all users will be onboard using newest 3.x we will
declare 2.x versions as obsolete.

Once two points above are checked, we will move on with the development
of new features as per roadmap: *per object access management*
and *group ownership*. Both these features will be included in 3.5 and will be shipped
in approximately 2-3 months from now. At least that is the plan.

Of course there will be minor releases in between which will include only bug fixes
and 3rd party dependencies updates.
