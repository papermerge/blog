Support for all other databases \u2014 such as SQLite, MariaDB, etc. \u2014 will be dropped.</p> <p>This may seem like a sudden decision, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the result of years of careful thought and experience.</p> <p>So, why just PostgreSQL?</p> <p>When an application commits to supporting multiple databases, there\u2019s an unavoidable limitation: it can only use the features that all supported databases share. That \u201clowest common denominator\u201d is surprisingly small.</p> <p>Take SQLite, for example. By design, it\u2019s lite. Supporting it means restricting Papermerge to a very limited subset of SQL features. For instance, SQLite lacks native support for fundamental types like UUID and JSON.</p> <p>Even when comparing more feature-rich systems like PostgreSQL and MariaDB, the issue persists. Each database is a different implementation. For developers, this translates into significantly more complexity: every new feature must be written, tested, and maintained across multiple engines\u2014multiplying the workload without adding real value.</p> <p>With version 3.6, Papermerge is embracing PostgreSQL as its database of choice. Development is already making use of PostgreSQL-specific functionality. For example, the audit feature relies on triggers written in plpgsql.</p> <p>To put it plainly:</p> <p>Starting with Papermerge 3.6, PostgreSQL will be the only supported database.</p>","tags":["technical"]},{"location":"2023/12/29/papermerge-30/","title":"Papermerge 3.0","text":"<p>I am very excited to announce the release of Papermerge DMS 3.0.</p> <p>Comparatively to all previous releases, version 3.0 underwent serious architectural changes.

Let me provide short description of the problem. The access to specific REST API endpoints was leaving DB connection open. The problem is that open DB connection were accumulating up to the point (which depends on specific DB configuration) when DB was refusing to accept more DB connections, which resulted of course to the whole app going offline.</p> <p>The root course of the problem is Django ORM and the way it handles DB connections. To mitigate the issue, we've decided start moving away from Django ORM to SQLAlchemy.
