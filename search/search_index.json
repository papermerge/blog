I won't bore reader with all technical details, I will just briefly mention two biggest technical changes:</p> <ul> <li>frontend rewritten in TS/React</li> <li>REST API now served with FastAPI</li> </ul> <p>Also, the format of storing files on the disk differs from previous versions - alone this fact makes version 3.0 incompatible with all previous releases.</p> <p>Here is the list of exciting features that version 3.0 brings:</p> <ul> <li>support for jpeg/png/tiff formats is back</li> <li>full text search is now backed up by Solr search engine</li> <li>multiple authentication backends are supported e.g. oauth2.0/OIDC (not documented yet)</li> <li>well documented REST API</li> <li>dual panel mode</li> <li>page management - delete, reorder, rotate, merge, move pages between documents</li> <li>OCR with text overlay (thanks to OCRMyPDF)</li> </ul> <p>Go to 3.0 documentation and play with docker compose setup.

Let me provide short description of the problem. The access to specific REST API endpoints was leaving DB connection open. The problem is that open DB connection were accumulating up to the point (which depends on specific DB configuration) when DB was refusing to accept more DB connections, which resulted of course to the whole app going offline.</p> <p>The root course of the problem is Django ORM and the way it handles DB connections. To mitigate the issue, we've decided start moving away from Django ORM to SQLAlchemy. Of course full transition to new ORM will span many releases, but the main point here is that for end users this transition is fully opaque.</p>","tags":["announcement"]},{"location":"2024/01/21/302-release/","title":"3.0.2 Release","text":"<p>Release 3.0.2 is a minor release which contains only bug fixes:</p> <ul> <li>Fix create_user to work with MySql/MariaDB/sqlite3 Issue#579</li> <li>Fix Error / Internal Server Error Issue#581</li> <li>Fix Error thrown after successful login Issue#307</li> <li>Fix wrong download URL for document version in viewer</li> <li>Fix nodes pagination (num_pages int rounded up instead of down)</li> </ul>","tags":["announcement"]},{"location":"2024/02/02/303-release/","title":"3.0.3 Release","text":"<p>Release 3.0.3 is a minor release which contains mostly bug fixes:</p>","tags":["announcement"]},{"location":"2024/02/02/303-release/#fixes","title":"Fixes","text":"<ul> <li>Logging out doesn't bring up log in dialogue Issue#574</li> <li>Ship spa, ita, fra, ron and por OCR languages data in docker image Issue#586</li> <li>Fix create_token.sh throws an error Issue#314</li> <li>Empty Folder on Second Page Issue#584</li> <li>Include Dutch language OCR data in default docker image</li> <li>Add Gujrati, Hindi and Sanskrit language codes Issue#583</li> </ul>","tags":["announcement"]},{"location":"2024/02/02/303-release/#adds","title":"Adds","text":"<ul> <li>[UI] Context Missing \"Extract Pages\" entry Issue#564</li> </ul>","tags":["announcement"]},{"location":"2024/02/23/31-release/","title":"3.1 Release","text":"<p>The most important part of release 3.1 are the the support of OpenLDAP and OAuth2 (Google and Github providers) authetication.</p>","tags":["papermerge3","announcement"]},{"location":"2024/02/23/31-release/#adds","title":"Adds","text":"<ul> <li>Support of OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers</li> <li>Support for OpenLDAP (RFC 4510) authentication</li> <li>Support for node's custom IDs Issue#325</li> <li>Exclude document from OCR Issue#598</li> </ul>","tags":["papermerge3","announcement"]},{"location":"2024/02/23/31-release/#fixes","title":"Fixes","text":"<ul> <li>Getting '500 - Internal Server Error' when patching node tags Issue#326</li> <li>papermerge-cli import option --delete without any function Issue#592</li> </ul> <p>The documentation for authentication part is here.</p>","tags":["papermerge3","announcement"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/oidc-support-is-here/","title":"OIDC Support is Here","text":"<p>Release 3.2 is out!</p> <p>It adds support for three important:</p> <ol> <li>authorization via granular permissions</li> <li>oidc authentication</li> <li>remote user authentication</li> </ol>","tags":["papermerge3","announcement"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/oidc-support-is-here/#authorization-via-granular-permissions","title":"Authorization via Granular Permissions","text":"<p>Now each user can be assigned a set of permissions (direct or via Groups).
